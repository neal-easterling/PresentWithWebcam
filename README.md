# Present with Webcam

## Description

A browser based presentation app that allows you to present your slideshow in the background while placing your webcam over the slides.  Also allows you to change the size of your webcam.  This app was rapidly developed to assist an ASL teacher who was working in a telepresence classroom.  She needed a way to spotlight her signing while presenting over a Cisco system.  All other solutions (using Google) needed to record in order to present.  V1 was rapidly developed over 2 days to address this need.  V1 is currently in use in classrooms and only works with Google Slides.<br><br>
